_**Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?**_

Artemis is a financial company looking to increase their presence online and reach a new audience. As they are a financial company, there is a greater incentive for attackers to target Artemis. This is another reason why Artemis is looking to be cautious. 

_**What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?**_

A base level of security is virtually required by law in the United States, especially considering Artemis deals in sensitive financial information. Security starts before the first line of code is even written. When designing the code, the first consideration should always be security and consumer interest. In today’s day and age data breaches can lead to companies losing their entire consumer base. Reputation is everything and if your company is known for being leaky and mishandling your information, nobody will want to utilize your services. This can also be very expensive for companies. Security is a constant battle where you can never let up. All code eventually becomes outdated, so maintenance is a priority.  

_**What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?**_ 

It was good to perform the dependency checks. I was able to see and experience firsthand checking a program for vulnerabilities and figuring out the proper solutions to them. I have a greater understanding of how you can resolve a lot of these issues by simply updating to the latest iteration.  

_**How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?**_

I followed the vulnerability assessment process flow diagram to see what techniques work for what scenarios. I believe in adding as many layers of security as possible if it falls within reason. If you are trying to protect sensitive information, I believe shielding that information with multiple layers of security is a MUST. However, small bits of basic information do not have to be as heavily guarded and can even negatively affect performance and speed for the user. Always test and test again.  

_**How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?**_

I made sure to test and test repeatedly. I checked the debugger for any warnings and errors and made sure they were correct starting from the top. Then I’d insert faulty inputs to see if my code could catch them. Constantly debugging and throwing faulty inputs to make sure the code doesn’t fold reassured me that I followed the right path.  
 

_**What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?**_ 

YouTube was extremely helpful to me in explaining the concepts I did not grasp well. Stack Overflow was a great resource to resolve issues I got when trying to compile my code. It helped me to see others have experienced the same or similar issues, and it helped me resolve the problems I was having.  I can see myself utilizing both in the future. 

 

_**Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?**_ 

I would gladly show employers my final software report. I believe it is a comprehensive collection of everything I’ve learned in this class thus far. I believe it contains many concepts that are valuable to software security. It contains everything from certificate generation to static testing, and a summary showing a deeper understanding of the relevant concepts.
